<h2>LITTLE JANE AND THE POOR MAN.</h2>

<p>This is little Jane Anderson and her sister. They have been out this
morning to take a walk. As they were coming home they saw a poor man
lying upon the ground. He was lame, and unable to walk. Jane and her
sister felt very sorry for him, and when they were about leaving they
gave him a few pennies which they had in their bags.&mdash;This was very kind
in the little girls. We were glad to see them so willing to part with
their pennies, that they might thus enable the old gentleman to buy a
loaf of bread or some cake for his dinner. We ought always to be ready
to supply the wants of the poor. We know not how soon

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page4" id="page4">[Pg 4]</a></span>

we ourselves may become poor, and need the aid of friends.</p>

<p>Did you ever learn the little hymn, which speaks about the poor? It is a
beautiful hymn. We wish you and your little sisters to learn it by
heart. Here it is&mdash;</p>


<p style="margin-left: 30%;">Whene'er I take my walks abroad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How many poor I see!</span><br />
What shall I render to my God<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For all his gifts to me?</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30%;">Not more than others I deserve,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet God has given me more:</span><br />
For I have food, while others starve,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or beg from door to door.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30%;">How many children in the street,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Half naked I behold!</span><br />
While I am clothed from head to feet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And covered from the cold.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30%;">While some poor creatures scarce can tell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where they may lay their head,</span><br />
I have a home, wherein to dwell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And rest upon my bed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30%;">While others early learn to swear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And curse, and lie, and steal,</span><br />
Lord, I am taught thy name to fear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And do thy holy will.</span></p>

<h2>THE RUDE GIRL.</h2>

<p>Jane Jones was a very rude girl. One morning she wished to visit one of
her companions. As she came to the gate, she found it was locked.
Instead of going into the house for the key, with which she might have
unlocked it, and gone through without danger, she undertook to climb
over the fence! In the picture on the next page, you can see her falling
head foremost to the ground. If her neck is not broken, she may be very
thankful.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page6" id="page6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/image4.jpg" width="600" height="434" alt="image4" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">THE RUDE GIRL.</span>
</div>

<p>How strange that children will ever be found climbing over fences! The
falls and bruises of their companions seem not to warn them of the
danger of it. We can scarcely pass through the streets without seeing
some upon the fence tops. Had this little girl just taken warning by
what she had seen the day before, it would now have been well with her.
But the fall of her school mate she soon

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page7" id="page7">[Pg 7]</a></span>

forgot&mdash;sooner than she will
forget the bruises she has now received.&mdash;Well, we hope that at least
she will keep off from fence tops hereafter. It is really too bad for
any girl to attempt to climb fences, and we are sure that none would
wish to, after such a fall as Jane has had.</p>

<p>Jane was soon able to be about again: but O, what a face did she carry!
Her cheeks were deeply scratched, and her nose was bruised almost to
flatness. The little girls with whom she formerly played could hardly
believe that it was Jane Jones, and although they loved her much they
could but pity her. Jane was never afterwards seen upon a fence: O, no!
she knew she had done wrong, and most carefully did she avoid going
where she might get another fall.</p>

<h2>THE CRUEL BOY.</h2>

<p>Ah! here is John Stevens. He took the little kitten, almost as soon as
it was born, and tied a string and a stone to its neck, and is now
throwing it into the river. Poor thing! how it will agonize and try to
get loose. But all will be in vain: the little kitten must drown.</p>

<p>And now, let us ask the little boy why he was led to such an act of
cruelty. He makes no answer. Verily, we should think he would feel
guilty, and certainly he looks heartily ashamed. We hope he will never
again be found engaged in such an act. If he has no parents to teach him
to do better, we pity him. But that is no excuse for doing wrong. We
would advise him to go to school, and there improve his time, and learn
to do better. We hope he will take our advice, and that we shall soon
have the pleasure of hearing that he has become a better boy.</p>

<h2>THE SCHOOL ROOM.</h2>


<p style="margin-left: 30%;">Here are little heads well fill'd,<br />
Some in learning greatly skill'd;<br />
Yet examine every face,<br />
Pleasure only you can trace.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a school room, where little boys and girls are taught to
spell, to read and to write. On the left hand side of the picture you
may see the school master busily engaged in preparing the copy books for
the boys. In the front part of the room you can see the monitor
examining the writing of one of the boys. Thus the masters set a good
example for industry. And we are glad to see the little boys ready to
follow it. They also are all busily engaged in their studies. All! did
we say? Alas! there are two who are mischievously playing. Do you not
see them? We are sorry that they should be found breaking the rules of
the school, while the other boys are studying their lessons, and
improving their minds.</p>

<h2>JANE THOMPSON.</h2>


<p>This is Jane Thompson; and I wish I could say that she was a good girl.
But her looks and actions show that she is very far from being good. She
is fretful and peevish, and when her mamma told her that it was time for
little folks to go to bed, she began to whine and pout, and said she did
not wish to go to bed then&mdash;she did not wish to go until nurse went.</p>

<p>No good child would have behaved in this manner, on being told that it
was bed-time. Oh, no. Good children are ever ready to obey their
parents, and cheerfully go to bed when their parents wish. What is there
more lovely than an obedient child! Let every little girl and boy learn
this beautiful verse. I will soon give you some others.</p>


<p style="margin-left: 30%;">My father, my mother, I know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I cannot your kindness repay;</span><br />
But I hope, that as older I grow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I shall learn your commands to obey.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page15" id="page15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE PASSIONATE BOY.</h2>

<p>Ah, lack-a-day! what's the matter now? Mary took your knife to fix her
doll, did she? Well, was there any thing very bad in that? Surely not.
You are making a terrible noise about a very little matter.</p>

<p>Yes, because this little girl had used her brother's knife, he became
very angry. And now you may see him violently throwing his sister's doll
upon the floor. Already he has broken its little arms, which you can see
scattered upon the floor. Ah, that is very wicked. No little boy or girl
ever ought to get angry. It is a passion which "leads to clubs, and
naked swords&mdash;to murder and to death."</p>

<p>Here is a little hymn which you may learn. We wish you to get it by
heart; and whenever you are tempted to be angry, at least stop long
enough to say it to the fourth verse. You will find it on the next
page.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page16" id="page16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<h3>AGAINST GETTING ANGRY.</h3>


<p style="margin-left: 30%;">Whatever brawls disturb the street,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There should be peace at home;</span><br />
Where sisters dwell and brothers meet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Quarrels should never come.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30%;">Birds in their little nests agree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And 'tis a shameful sight,</span><br />
When children of one family<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fall out, and chide, and fight.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30%;">Hard names at first, and threatening words,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which are but noisy breath,</span><br />
May grow to clubs and naked swords;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To murder, and to death.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30%;">The devil tempts one mother's son<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To rage against another;</span><br />
So wicked Cain was hurried on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Till he had killed his brother.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30%;">The wise will make their anger <ins class="correction" title="original: coo">cool</ins>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At least, before 'tis night;</span><br />
But in the bosom of a fool<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It burns till morning light.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30%;">Pardon, O Lord, our childish rage,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our little brawls remove;</span><br />
That, as we grow to riper age,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our hearts may all be love.</span></p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
